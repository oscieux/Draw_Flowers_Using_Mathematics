<p><em>"The scientist does not study nature because it is useful;
he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful." (Henri Poincar√©)</em></p>
<p>There are many examples of <em>natural facts</em> that can be described in mathematical terms.
Nice examples are the shape of snowflakes, the <em>fractal geometry</em> of romanesco broccoli or how self-similarity rules the growth of plants.</p>
<p>R is a tool for doing serious analysis, but not everything in life is serious.
Life is also funny, and R can be used to have fun and to do beautiful things.
Its graphical power can be used to produce artistic images like the one that illustrates this section, which is inspired by how plants arrange their leaves.
This fact is called <em>phyllotaxis</em> and will serve as the basis of this project.</p>
<p>In this notebook, we are using the <code>ggplot2</code> package.
Apart from having fun, we will learn many important features of it that will be useful not only to do art but also to represent data in real-life problems.
Let's start by loading the library.</p>
